Welcome to Workout.Map()!! 

This simple to use project uses a free map API provided by Leftlet, to track your workouts. This usful app can track 2 types of workouts, running and cycling. To get started just click a point on the map where you began a workout, select the type of workout you did, enter the distance and duration of the workout, as well as the steps or elevation gain/loss.This API uses your browsers geolocation so when you first open the page, it should lock onto your position. But make sure to check first if you are using the correct map and location. 

Once you have recorded several workouts, you can toggle between the rendered forms and the screen will move to the pin that has holds the specific workout that was selected. 

There is no need to worry about losing a workout due to closing the page or refreshing, all workouts are saved to your browser's local storage and will remain rendered. If you are looking to clear these workouts and start fresh, then head into the browsers console and type "app.reset()" + enter and the page should to cleared. 

I hope you have as much fun using this app as I did making it :)

Thank you.
